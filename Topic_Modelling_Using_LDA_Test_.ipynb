Intermediate-age and old open clusters\\nare less common, and it is even harder to find them inside the solar\\nGalactocentric radius, due to the high mortality rate and strong extinction\\ninside this region. NGC 6802 is one of the inner disk open clusters (IOCs)\\nobserved by the $Gaia$-ESO survey (GES). This cluster is an important target\\nfor calibrating the abundances derived in the survey due to the kinematic and\\nchemical homogeneity of the members in open clusters. Using the measurements\\nfrom $Gaia$-ESO internal data release 4 (iDR4), we identify 95 main-sequence\\ndwarfs as cluster members from the GIRAFFE target list, and eight giants as\\ncluster members from the UVES target list. The dwarf cluster members have a\\nmedian radial velocity of $13.6\\pm1.9$ km s$^{-1}$, while the giant cluster\\nmembers have a median radial velocity of $12.0\\pm0.9$ km s$^{-1}$ and a median\\n[Fe/H] of $0.10\\pm0.02$ dex. The color-magnitude diagram of these cluster\\nmembers suggests an age of $0.9\\pm0.1$ Gyr, with $(m-M)_0=11.4$ and\\n$E(B-V)=0.86$. We perform the first detailed chemical abundance analysis of NGC\\n6802, including 27 elemental species. To gain a more general picture about\\nIOCs, the measurements of NGC 6802 are compared with those of other IOCs\\npreviously studied by GES, that is, NGC 4815, Trumpler 20, NGC 6705, and\\nBerkeley 81. NGC 6802 shows similar C, N, Na, and Al abundances as other IOCs.\\nThese elements are compared with nucleosynthetic models as a function of\\ncluster turn-off mass.

Another factor of complexity, whereby the computation\\nis allowed to take place in a precision different from the storage precisions\\nof either A or B, is also included in the discussion. We first break the\\nproblem into mostly orthogonal dimensions, considering the mixing of domains\\nseparately from mixing precisions. Support for all combinations of matrix\\noperands stored in either the real or complex domain is mapped out by\\nenumerating the cases and describing an implementation approach for each.\\nSupporting all combinations of storage and computation precisions is handled by\\ntypecasting the matrices at key stages of the computation---during packing\\nand/or accumulation, as needed. Several optional optimizations are also\\ndocumented. Performance results gathered on a 56-core Marvell ThunderX2 and a\\n52-core Intel Xeon Platinum demonstrate that high performance is mostly\\npreserved, with modest slowdowns incurred from unavoidable typecast\\ninstructions. The mixed-datatype implementation confirms that combinatoric\\nintractability is avoided, with the framework relying on only two assembly\\nmicrokernels to implement 128 datatype combinations.\\n</td>\n",

We give a\\ndetailed analysis of an ad-hoc protocol on which the witness-functions succeed\\nin proving its correctness for secrecy while the interpretation-functions fail\\nto do so.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

We approach the problem of implementing mixed-datatype support within the\\ngeneral matrix multiplication (GEMM) operation of the BLIS framework, whereby\\neach matrix operand A, B, and C may be stored as single- or double-precision\\nreal or complex values. Another factor of complexity, whereby the computation\\nis allowed to take place in a precision different from the storage precisions\\nof either A or B, is also included in the discussion. We first break the\\nproblem into mostly orthogonal dimensions, considering the mixing of domains\\nseparately from mixing precisions. Support for all combinations of matrix\\noperands stored in either the real or complex domain is mapped out by\\nenumerating the cases and describing an implementation approach for each.\\nSupporting all combinations of storage and computation precisions is handled by\\ntypecasting the matrices at key stages of the computation---during packing\\nand/or accumulation, as needed. Several optional optimizations are also\\ndocumented. Performance results gathered on a 56-core Marvell ThunderX2 and a\\n52-core Intel Xeon Platinum demonstrate that high performance is mostly\\npreserved, with modest slowdowns incurred from unavoidable typecast\\ninstructions. The mixed-datatype implementation confirms that combinatoric\\nintractability is avoided, with the framework relying on only two assembly\\nmicrokernels to implement 128 datatype combinations.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

As a consequence, for every $d\\geqslant 2$, every\\n$d$-dimensional grid graph is $Q_d$-supermagic where $Q_d$ is the $d$-cube.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

This cluster is an important target\\nfor calibrating the abundances derived in the survey due to the kinematic and\\nchemical homogeneity of the members in open clusters. Using the measurements\\nfrom $Gaia$-ESO internal data release 4 (iDR4), we identify 95 main-sequence\\ndwarfs as cluster members from the GIRAFFE target list, and eight giants as\\ncluster members from the UVES target list. The dwarf cluster members have a\\nmedian radial velocity of $13.6\\pm1.9$ km s$^{-1}$, while the giant cluster\\nmembers have a median radial velocity of $12.0\\pm0.9$ km s$^{-1}$ and a median\\n[Fe/H] of $0.10\\pm0.02$ dex. The color-magnitude diagram of these cluster\\nmembers suggests an age of $0.9\\pm0.1$ Gyr, with $(m-M)_0=11.4$ and\\n$E(B-V)=0.86$. We perform the first detailed chemical abundance analysis of NGC\\n6802, including 27 elemental species. To gain a more general picture about\\nIOCs, the measurements of NGC 6802 are compared with those of other IOCs\\npreviously studied by GES, that is, NGC 4815, Trumpler 20, NGC 6705, and\\nBerkeley 81. NGC 6802 shows similar C, N, Na, and Al abundances as other IOCs.\\nThese elements are compared with nucleosynthetic models as a function of\\ncluster turn-off mass.

Frames aggregated at the AMSDU level use\\na common CRC check to enforce integrity. For longer aggregated AMSDU frames,\\nthe packet error rate increases significantly for the same bit error rate.\\nHence, multiple studies have proposed doing AMSDU aggregation adaptively based\\non the error rate.

              "3  20976  ...    Milky Way open clusters are very diverse in terms of age, chemical\\ncomposition, and kinematic properties. Intermediate-age and old open clusters\\nare less common, and it is even harder to find them inside the solar\\nGalactocentric radius, due to the high mortality rate and strong extinction\\ninside this region. NGC 6802 is one of the inner disk open clusters (IOCs)\\nobserved by the $Gaia$-ESO survey (GES). This cluster is an important target\\nfor calibrating the abundances derived in the survey due to the kinematic and\\nchemical homogeneity of the members in open clusters. Using the measurements\\nfrom $Gaia$-ESO internal data release 4 (iDR4), we identify 95 main-sequence\\ndwarfs as cluster members from the GIRAFFE target list, and eight giants as\\ncluster members from the UVES target list. The dwarf cluster members have a\\nmedian radial velocity of $13.6\\pm1.9$ km s$^{-1}$, while the giant cluster\\nmembers have a median radial velocity of $12.0\\pm0.9$ km s$^{-1}$ and a median\\n[Fe/H] of $0.10\\pm0.02$ dex. The color-magnitude diagram of these cluster\\nmembers suggests an age of $0.9\\pm0.1$ Gyr, with $(m-M)_0=11.4$ and\\n$E(B-V)=0.86$. We perform the first detailed chemical abundance analysis of NGC\\n6802, including 27 elemental species. To gain a more general picture about\\nIOCs, the measurements of NGC 6802 are compared with those of other IOCs\\npreviously studied by GES, that is, NGC 4815, Trumpler 20, NGC 6705, and\\nBerkeley 81. NGC 6802 shows similar C, N, Na, and Al abundances as other IOCs.\\nThese elements are compared with nucleosynthetic models as a function of\\ncluster turn-off mass. The $\\alpha$, iron-peak, and neutron-capture elements\\nare also explored in a self-consistent way.\\n\n",

Proving that a cryptographic protocol is correct for secrecy is a hard task.\\nOne of the strongest strategies to reach this goal is to show that it is\\nincreasing, which means that the security level of every single atomic message\\nexchanged in the protocol, safely evaluated, never deceases. Recently, two\\nfamilies of functions have been proposed to measure the security level of\\natomic messages. The first one is the family of interpretation-functions. The\\nsecond is the family of witness-functions. In this paper, we show that the\\nwitness-functions are more efficient than interpretation-functions. We give a\\ndetailed analysis of an ad-hoc protocol on which the witness-functions succeed\\nin proving its correctness for secrecy while the interpretation-functions fail\\nto do so.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
